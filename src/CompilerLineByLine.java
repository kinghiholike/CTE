        /*The variables num, numm, nummm, summation, and multi are not declared as valid data types. In addition, the keyword INTEG is not a valid keyword in any programming language I am aware of.

The assignment operator =-/ is not a valid operator in any programming language. The correct operator for subtraction is -.

The expression <s%*h - j / w - d +*$& is not a valid expression and does not make any sense.

The input statement INPUT num, numm, nummm should come before the calculation of numm.

The variable temp is not declared and assigned a value before it is used in the expression WRITEE temp.

The expression J/K-p+w*Q/s contains variables that are not declared or assigned values.

To fix these issues, you would need to revise the program and use a valid programming language with proper syntax. Here is an example of how you could write a program in Python to accomplish the same task of finding the summation of three numbers and calculating and printing out temp:*/
